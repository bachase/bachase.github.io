<p>
        The diagram above is an overview of the consensus process from the perspective
        of a single participant. Recall that during a single consensus round, a node
        is trying to agree with its peers on which transactions to apply to its prior
        ledger when generating the next ledger. It also attempts to agree on the
        network time when the ledger closed (see section below for details). There
        are 3 main phases to a consensus round:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
            A call to <code class="literal">startRound</code> places the node in the <code class="literal">Open</code>
            phase. In this phase, the node is waiting for transactions to include
            in its open ledger.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            At some point, the node <code class="literal">Close=s the open ledger and transitions
            to the =Establish</code> phase. In this phase, the node shares/receives
            peer proposals on which transactions should be accepted in the closed
            ledger.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            At some point, the node determines it has reached consensus with its
            peers on which transactions to include. It transitions to the <code class="literal">Accept</code>
            phase. In this phase, the node works on applying the transactions to
            the prior ledger to generate a new closed ledger. Once the new ledger
            is completed, the node shares the validated ledger hash with the network
            and makes a call to <code class="literal">startRound</code> to start the cycle
            again for the next ledger.
          </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        Throughout, a heartbeat timer calls <code class="literal">timerEntry</code> at a regular
        frequency to drive the process forward. Although the <code class="literal">startRound</code>
        call occurs at arbitrary times based on when the initial round began and
        the time it takes to apply transactions, the transitions from <code class="literal">Open</code>
        to <code class="literal">Establish</code> and <code class="literal">Establish</code> to <code class="literal">Accept</code>
        only occur during calls to <code class="literal">timerEntry</code>. Similarly, transactions
        can arrive at arbitrary times, independent of the heartbeat timer. Transactions
        received after the <code class="literal">Open</code> to <code class="literal">Close</code> transition
        won't be considered until the next consensus round, represented above by
        the light green triangles.
      </p>
<p>
        Peer proposals are issued by a node during a <code class="literal">timerEntry</code>
        call, but since peers do not synchronize <code class="literal">timerEntry</code> calls,
        they are received by other peers at arbitrary times. Peer proposals are only
        considered if received prior to the <code class="literal">Establish</code> to <code class="literal">Accept</code>
        transition, and only if the peer is working on the same prior ledger. Peer
        proposals received after consensus is reached will not be meaningful and
        are represented above by the circle with the X in it. Only proposals from
        chosen peers are considered.

            of transactions within the set, nor does it specify how to apply a transaction
            set to a ledger to generate a new ledger. A unique ID distinguishes a
            set of transactions from all other sets of transactions.

            The choice of peers is not symmetric, since participants can decide on
            their chosen sets independently.

<li class="listitem">
            A <span class="emphasis"><em>position</em></span> is the current belief of the next ledger's
            transaction set and close time. Position can refer to the node's own
            position or the position of a peer.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            A <span class="emphasis"><em>proposal</em></span> is one of a sequence of positions a node
            shares during consensus. An initial proposal contains the starting position
            taken by a node before it considers any peer positions. If a node subsequently
            updates its position in response to its peers, it will issue an updated
            proposal. A proposal is uniquely identified by the ID of the proposing
            node, the ID of the position taken, the ID of the prior ledger the proposal
            is for, and the sequence number of the proposal.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            A <span class="emphasis"><em>dispute</em></span> is a transaction that is either not part
            of a node's position or not in a peer's position. During consensus, the
            node will add or remove disputed transactions from its position based
            on that transaction's support amongst its peers.
          </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        Note that most types have an ID as a lightweight identifier of instances
        of that type. Consensus often operates on the IDs directly since the underlying
        type is potentially expensive to share over the network. For example, proposal's
        only contain the ID of the position of a peer. Since many peers likely have
        the same position, this reduces the need to send the full transaction set
        multiple times. Instead, a node can request the transaction set from the
        network if necessary.
      </p>

        <span class="phrase"><a name="rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.effective_close_time"></a></span><a class="link" href="consensus_overview.html#rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.effective_close_time">Effective
        Close Time</a>
      </h5>
<p>
        In addition to agreeing on a transaction set, each consensus round tries
        to agree on the time the ledger closed. Each node calculates its own close
        time when it closes the open ledger. This exact close time is rounded to
        the nearest multiple of the current <span class="emphasis"><em>effective close time resolution</em></span>.
        It is this <span class="emphasis"><em>effective close time</em></span> that nodes seek to agree
        on. This allows servers to derive a common time for a ledger without the
        need for perfectly synchronized clocks. As depicted below, the 3 pink arrows
        represent exact close times from 3 consensus nodes that round to the same
        effective close time given the current resolution. The purple arrow represents
        a peer whose estimate rounds to a different effective close time given the
        current resolution.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../../images/consensus/EffCloseTime.png"></span>
      </p>
<p>
        The effective close time is part of the node's position and is shared with
        peers in its proposals. Just like the position on the consensus transaction
        set, a node will update its close time position in response to its peers'
        effective close time positions. Peers can agree to disagree on the close
        time, in which case the effective close time is taken as 1 second past the
        prior close.
      </p>
<p>
        The close time resolution is itself dynamic, decreasing (coarser) resolution
        in subsequent consensus rounds if nodes are unable to reach consensus on
        an effective close time and increasing (finer) resolution if nodes consistently
        reach close time consensus.

      </h5>
<p>
        Internally, a node operates under one of the following consensus modes. Either
        of the first two modes may be chosen when a consensus round starts.
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Proposing</em></span> indicates the node is a full-fledged consensus
            participant. It takes on positions and sends proposals to its peers.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Observing</em></span> indicates the node is a passive consensus
            participant. It maintains a position internally, but does not propose
            that position to its peers. Instead, it receives peer proposals and updates
            its position to track the majority of its peers. This may be preferred
            if the node is only being used to track the state of the network or during
            a start-up phase while it is still synchronizing with the network.
          </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        The other two modes are set internally during the consensus round when the
        node believes it is no longer working on the dominant ledger chain based
        on peer validations. It checks this on every call to <code class="literal">timerEntry</code>.
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
            <span class="underline">Wrong Ledger</span> indicates the node
            is not working on the correct prior ledger and does not have it available.
            It requests that ledger from the network, but continues to work towards
            consensus this round while waiting. If it had been <span class="emphasis"><em>proposing</em></span>,
            it will send a special "bowout" proposal to its peers to indicate
            its change in mode for the rest of this round. For the duration of the
            round, it defers to peer positions for determining the consensus outcome
            as if it were just <span class="emphasis"><em>observing</em></span>.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            <span class="underline">Switch Ledger</span> indicates that the
            node has acquired the correct prior ledger from the network. Although
            it now has the correct prior ledger, the fact that it had the wrong one
            at some point during this round means it is likely behind and should
            defer to peer positions for determining the consensus outcome.
          </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../../images/consensus/consensus_modes.png"></span>
      </p>
<p>
        Once either of wrong ledge or switch ledger are reached, the node cannot
        return to proposing or observing until the next consensus round. However,
        the node could change its view of the correct prior ledger, so going from
        switch ledger to wrong ledger and back again is possible.
      </p>
<p>
        The distinction between the wrong and switched ledger modes arises because
        a ledger's unique identifier may be known by a node before the ledger itself.
        This reflects that fact that the data corresponding to a ledger may be large
        and take time to share over the network, whereas the smaller ID could be
        shared in a peer validation much more quickly. Distinguishing the two states
        allows the node to decide how best to generate the next ledger once it declares
        consensus.

      </h5>
<p>
        As depicted in the overview diagram, consensus is best viewed as a progression
        through 3 phases. There are 4 public methods of the generic consensus algorithm
        that determine this progression

<li class="listitem">
            <code class="literal">gotTxSet</code> is called when a transaction set is received
            from the network. This is typically in response to a prior request from
            the node to acquire the transaction set corresponding to a disagreeing
            peer's position.
          </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        The following subsections describe each consensus phase in more detail and
        what actions are taken in response to these calls.
      </p>
<h4>
<a name="rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.h4"></a>
        <span class="phrase"><a name="rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.accept"></a></span><a class="link" href="consensus_overview.html#rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.accept">Accept</a>
      </h4>
<p>
        The accept phase is the terminal phase of the consensus algorithm. Calls
        to <code class="literal">timerEntry</code>, <code class="literal">peerProposal</code> and <code class="literal">gotTxSet</code>
        will not change the internal consensus state. A call to <code class="literal">startRound</code>
        will kick off the next consensus round. It provides the new prior ledger,
        prior ledger ID and whether the round should begin in the proposing or observing
        mode. After setting some initial state, the phase transitions to <code class="literal">Open</code>.
        The node will check if the provided prior ledger and ID are correct, updating
        the mode and requesting the proper ledger from the network if necessary.
      </p>
<h4>
<a name="rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.h5"></a>
        <span class="phrase"><a name="rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.open"></a></span><a class="link" href="consensus_overview.html#rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.open">Open</a>
      </h4>
<p>
        The <code class="literal">Open</code> phase is a quiescent period to allow transactions
        to build up in the node's open ledger. The duration is a trade-off between
        latency and throughput. A shorter window reduces the latency to generating
        the next ledger, but also reduces transaction throughput due to fewer transactions
        accepted into the ledger.
      </p>
<p>
        A call to <code class="literal">startRound</code> would forcibly begin the next consensus
        round, skipping completion of the current round. This is not expected during
        normal operation. Calls to <code class="literal">peerProposal</code> or <code class="literal">gotTxSet</code>
        simply store the proposal or transaction set for use in the coming <code class="literal">Establish</code>
        phase.
      </p>
<p>
        A call to <code class="literal">timerEntry</code> first checks that the node is working
        on the correct prior ledger. If not, it will update the mode and request
        the correct ledger. Otherwise, the node checks whether to switch to the
        <code class="literal">Establish</code> phase. Under normal circumstances, this occurs
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
            if there are transactions in the open ledger and more than <code class="literal">LEDGER_MIN_CLOSE</code>
            have elapsed OR
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            if there are no open transactions and a suitably longer idle interval
            has elapsed.
          </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        The longer idle interval increases the opportunity to get some transaction
        into the next ledger and avoids doing useless work closing an empty ledger.
      </p>
<p>
        Additionally, the node closes if more than half the number of prior round
        peers have already closed or finished this round, as this indicates the node
        is falling behind and needs to catch up.
      </p>
<p>
        When closing the ledger, the node takes its initial position based on the
        transactions in the open ledger at that time. It also uses the current time
        as its initial close time estimate. If in the proposing mode, the node shares
        its initial position with peers. Now that the node has taken a position,
        it will consider any peer positions for this round that arrived earlier.
        The node generates disputed transactions for each transaction not in common
        with a peer's position. The node also records the vote of each peer for each
        disputed transaction. In the example below, transactions 2,3 and 4 are in
        dispute.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../../images/consensus/disputes.png" width="20%"></span>

<h4>

        <span class="phrase"><a name="rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.establish"></a></span><a class="link" href="consensus_overview.html#rippled.consensus_and_validation.consensus_overview.establish">Establish</a>
      </h4>
<p>
        The establish phase is the active period of consensus in which the node exchanges
        proposals with peers in an attempt to reach agreement on the consensus transactions
        and effective close time.
      </p>
<p>
        A call to <code class="literal">startRound</code> would forcibly begin the next consensus
        round, skipping completion of the current round. This is not expected during
        normal operation. Calls to <code class="literal">peerProposal</code> or <code class="literal">gotTxSet</code>
        that reflect new positions will generate disputed transactions for any new
        disagreements and will update the peer's vote for all disputed transactions.
      </p>
<p>
        A call to <code class="literal">timerEntry</code> first checks that the node is working
        from the correct prior ledger. If not, the node will update the mode and
        request the correct ledger. Otherwise, the node updates the node's position
        and considers whether to switch to the <code class="literal">Accepted</code> phase
        and declare consensus reached. However, at least <code class="literal">LEDGER_MIN_CONSENSUS</code>
        time must have elapsed before doing either. This allows peer's an opportunity
        to take an initial position and share it.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Update Position</em></span>
      </p>
<p>
        In order to achieve consensus, the node is looking for a transaction set
        that is supported by a super-majority of peers. The node works towards this
        set by adding or removing disputed transactions from its position based on
        an increasing threshold for inclusion.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../../images/consensus/threshold.png" width="50%"></span>
      </p>
<p>
        By starting with a lower threshold, a node initially allows a wide set of
        transactions into its position. If the establish round continues and the
        node is "stuck", a higher threshold can focus on accepting transactions
        with the most support. The constants that define the thresholds and durations
        at which the thresholds change are given by <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">AV_XXX_CONSENSUS_PCT</span></code>
        and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">AV_XXX_CONSENSUS_TIME</span></code>
        respectively, where <code class="literal">XXX</code> is <code class="literal">INIT</code>,<code class="literal">MID</code>,<code class="literal">LATE</code>
        and <code class="literal">STUCK</code>. The effective close time position is updated
        using the same thresholds.
      </p>
<p>
        Given the example disputes above and an initial threshold of 50%, our node
        would retain its position since transaction 1 was not in dispute and transactions
        2 and 3 have 75% support. Since its position did not change, it would not
        need to send a new proposal to peers. Peer C would not change either. Peer
        A would add transaction 3 to its position and Peer B would remove transaction
        4 from its position; both would then send an updated position.
      </p>
<p>
        Conversely, if the diagram reflected a later call to <code class="literal">timerEntry</code>
        that occurs in the stuck region with a threshold of say 95%, our node would
        remove transactions 2 and 3 from its candidate set and send an updated position.
        Likewise, all the other peers would end up with only transaction 1 in their
        position.
      </p>
<p>
        Lastly, if our node were not in the proposing mode, it would not include
        its own vote and just take the majority (&gt;50%) position of its peers.
        In this example, our node would maintain its position of transactions 1,
        2 and 3.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Checking Consensus</em></span>
      </p>
<p>
        After updating its position, the node checks for supermajority agreement
        with its peers on its current position. This agreement is of the exact transaction
        set, not just the support of individual transactions. That is, if our position
        is a subset of a peer's position, that counts as a disagreement. Also recall
        that effective close time agreement allows a supermajority of participants
        agreeing to disagree.
      </p>
<p>
        Consensus is declared when the following 3 clauses are true:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
            <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">LEDGER_MIN_CONSENSUS</span></code>
            time has elapsed in the establish phase
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            At least 75% of the prior round proposers have proposed OR this establish
            phase is <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">LEDGER_MIN_CONSENSUS</span></code>
            longer than the last round's establish phase
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            <code class="literal">minimumConsensusPercentage</code> of ourself and our peers
            share the same position
          </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        The middle condition ensures slower peers have a chance to share positions,
        but prevents waiting too long on peers that have disconnected. Additionally,
        a node can declare that consensus has moved on if <code class="literal">minimumConsensusPercentage</code>
        peers have sent validations and moved on to the next ledger. This outcome
        indicates the node has fallen behind its peers and needs to catch up.
      </p>
<p>
        If a node is not proposing, it does not include its own position when calculating
        the percent of agreeing participants but otherwise follows the above logic.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Accepting Consensus</em></span>
      </p>
<p>
        Once consensus is reached (or moved on), the node switches to the <code class="literal">Accept</code>
        phase and signals to the implementing code that the round is complete. That
        code is responsible for using the consensus transaction set to generate the
        next ledger and calling <code class="literal">startRound</code> to begin the next round.
        The implementation has total freedom on ordering transactions, deciding what
        to do if consensus moved on, determining whether to retry or abandon local
        transactions that did not make the consensus set and updating any internal
        state based on the consensus progress.
