      Consensus is the task of reaching agreement within a distributed system in
      the presence of faulty or even malicious participants. This document outlines
      the <a href="https://ripple.com/files/ripple/consensus/whitepaper.pdf" target="_top">Ripple
      Consensus Algorithm</a> as implemented in <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled" target="_top">rippled</a>,
      but focuses on its utility as a generic consensus algorithm independent of
      the detailed mechanics of the Ripple Consensus Ledger. Most notably, the algorithm
      does not require fully synchronous communication between all nodes in the network,
      or even a fixed network topology, but instead achieves consensus via collectively
      trusted subnetworks.

<p>
      A challenge for distributed systems is reaching agreement on changes in shared
      state. For the Ripple network, the shared state is the current ledger--account
      information, account balances, order books and other financial data. We will
      refer to shared distributed state as a <span class="emphasis"><em>ledger</em></span> throughout
      the remainder of this document.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/consensus/ledger_chain.png" width="50%"></span>
    </p>
<p>
      As shown above, new ledgers are made by applying a set of transactions to the
      prior ledger. For the Ripple network, transactions include payments, modification
      of account settings, updates to offers and more.
    </p>
<p>
      In a centralized system, generating the next ledger is trivial since there
      is a single unique arbiter of which transactions to include and how to apply
      them to a ledger. For decentralized systems, participants must resolve disagreements
      on the set of transactions to include, the order to apply those transactions,
      and even the resulting ledger after applying the transactions. This is even
      more difficult when some participants are faulty or malicious.
    </p>
<p>
      The Ripple network is a decentralized and <span class="underline">trust-full</span>
      network. Anyone is free to join and participants are free to choose a subset
      of peers that are collectively trusted to not collude in an attempt to defraud
      the participant. Leveraging this network of trust, the Ripple algorithm has
      two main components.

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Consensus</em></span> in which network participants agree on the
          transactions to apply to a prior ledger, based on the positions of their
          chosen peers.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Validation</em></span> in which network participants agree on
          what ledger was generated, based on the ledgers generated by chosen peers.
        </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      These phases are continually repeated to process transactions submitted to
      the network, generating successive ledgers and giving rise to the blockchain
      ledger history depicted below. In this diagram, time is flowing to the right,
      but links between ledgers point backward to the parent. Also note the alternate
      Ledger 2 that was generated by some participants, but which failed validation
      and was abandoned.

      The remainder of this section describes the Consensus and Validation algorithms
      in more detail and is meant as a companion guide to understanding the generic
      implementation in <code class="literal">rippled</code>. The document <span class="bold"><strong>does
      not</strong></span> discuss correctness, fault-tolerance or liveness properties
      of the algorithms or the full details of how they integrate within <code class="literal">rippled</code>
      to support the Ripple Consensus Ledger.
